"The method of use is very simple! Download this document, copy it onto a USB flash drive, 
and insert it into the car's DVD player. The car's driver will automatically install, and 
the DVD player will start!

This problem occurs every time you lose the car's GPS disk but have removed the car battery, 
causing the DVD to reset!

Usually, the error message is: 'A program cannot be read. Please consult a dealer.'"
